## Entry Level Questions

### Q1: ML Fundamentals - Learning Types
**Question:** What's the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning?

**Answer:**
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data (input-output pairs)
  - Example: Email spam classification
  - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
  - Example: Customer segmentation using clustering
  - Common algorithms: K-means, PCA, DBSCAN
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment via rewards/penalties
  - Example: Game playing (AlphaGo), robot control
  - Common algorithms: Q-learning, Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic

### Q2: Statistics - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
**Question:** Explain bias-variance tradeoff and its relation to overfitting/underfitting.

**Answer:**
- **Bias**: Error from oversimplified assumptions (underfitting)
  - High bias = model too simple, misses relevant patterns
- **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to small changes in training data (overfitting)  
  - High variance = model too complex, memorizes noise
- **Sweet Spot**: Balance both for optimal generalization
- **Formula**: Total Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error

### Q3: Data Preprocessing - Missing Values
**Question:** How would you handle missing values in a dataset?

**Answer:**
- **Deletion**: Remove rows/columns (when <5% missing, data abundant)
- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Fill with central tendency
- **Forward/Backward Fill**: Use previous/next values (time series)
- **Model-based**: Use ML to predict missing values (KNN, regression)
- **Domain-specific**: Business logic (missing income = 0 for students)

### Q4: Model Evaluation - Imbalanced Data
**Question:** You have 95% class imbalance. Why is accuracy poor? What metrics to use?

**Answer:**
Accuracy misleading because predicting majority class gives 95% accuracy.

**Better metrics:**
- **Precision**: TP/(TP+FP) - of predicted positives, how many correct?
- **Recall**: TP/(TP+FN) - of actual positives, how many caught?
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision/recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under ROC curve (threshold independent)
- **PR-AUC**: Precision-Recall curve (better for imbalanced)

## Intermediate Level Questions

### Q5: Deep Learning - Vanishing Gradients
**Question:** Explain vanishing gradient problem and solutions.

**Answer:**
**Problem**: Gradients become exponentially smaller in early layers during backpropagation

**Solutions:**
- **Skip Connections**: ResNet-style shortcuts allow gradients to flow directly
- **Better Activations**: ReLU instead of sigmoid/tanh (no saturation)
- **Normalization**: Batch/Layer normalization stabilizes training
- **Proper Initialization**: Xavier/He initialization prevents gradient explosion/vanishing
- **LSTM/GRU**: For RNNs, use gating mechanisms

### Q6: Feature Engineering - High Cardinality Categoricals
**Question:** Categorical feature with 1000 unique values. How to encode?

**Answer:**
- **Target Encoding**: Replace with mean target value (risk: overfitting)
- **Frequency Encoding**: Replace with category frequency
- **Embeddings**: Learn dense representations (works with deep learning)
- **Hashing**: Hash categories to fixed-size buckets
- **Rare Category Grouping**: Group infrequent categories as "Other"

### Q7: Architecture Comparison
**Question:** Compare CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. When to use each?

**Answer:**
- **CNNs**: 
  - Best for: Spatial data (images), translation invariant features
  - Architecture: Convolutional layers + pooling + fully connected
  - Use cases: Computer vision, spatial pattern recognition

- **RNNs**: 
  - Best for: Sequential data with temporal dependencies
  - Architecture: Recurrent connections, hidden state memory

  - Architecture: Self-attention mechanism, no recurrence
  - Use cases: Modern NLP, vision (ViT), multimodal tasks

### Q8: Optimizers Comparison
**Question:** Compare SGD, Adam, and RMSprop optimizers.

**Answer:**
- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**:
  - Simple, good for convex problems
  - Needs careful learning rate tuning
  - Add momentum to accelerate convergence
  - Use when: Simple problems, fine-tuning pretrained models

- **RMSprop**:
  - Adapts learning rate per parameter
  - Good for non-stationary objectives
  - Use when: RNN training, non-convex optimization

- **Adam**:
  - Combines momentum + adaptive learning rates
  - Generally robust default choice
  - Can have convergence issues in some cases
  - Use when: Most deep learning scenarios, starting point for new projects

## Senior Level Questions

### Q11: Distributed Training Strategies
**Question:** Train 10B parameter model. Compare parallelism strategies.

**Answer:**
**Data Parallelism:**
- Same model copy on each GPU, different data batches
- Gradients averaged across GPUs after each batch
- **When to use**: Model fits on single GPU, abundant data
- **Limitation**: Communication overhead scales with model size

**Model Parallelism:**
- Different model parts on different GPUs
- **Tensor Parallelism**: Split individual layers across GPUs
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Different layers on different GPUs
- **When to use**: Model too large for single GPU (10B parameter case)

**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended for 10B):
```
Pipeline stages:
├── Stage 1: Layers 1-8  (GPU 0-1)
├── Stage 2: Layers 9-16 (GPU 2-3)  
├── Stage 3: Layers 17-24 (GPU 4-5)
└── Data parallelism across multiple nodes
```

### Q12: Attention Mechanisms Deep Dive
**Question:** Explain attention in transformers. Why multi-head attention?

**Answer:**
**Core Attention Formula:**
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V

Where:
- Q = Queries (what we're looking for)
- K = Keys (what to match against)  
- V = Values (what to retrieve)
- d_k = dimension of keys (for scaling)
```

**Multi-Head Attention Benefits:**
- **Different Relationship Types**: Each head learns different patterns
  - Head 1: Syntactic relationships
  - Head 2: Semantic relationships  
  - Head 3: Long-range dependencies
- **Parallel Computation**: All heads computed simultaneously
- **Ensemble Effect**: Multiple perspectives improve robustness
- **Increased Expressiveness**: More parameters for complex relationships

**Implementation Concept:**
```python
def multi_head_attention(x, num_heads=8):
    d_model = x.shape[-1]
    d_k = d_model // num_heads
    
    # Create multiple heads
    heads = []
    for i in range(num_heads):
        Q = Linear(d_model, d_k)(x)
        K = Linear(d_model, d_k)(x)  
        V = Linear(d_model, d_k)(x)
        
        attention = softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k)) @ V
        heads.append(attention)
    
    # Concatenate and project
    return Linear(d_model, d_model)(concat(heads))
```

### Q13: Real-time Fraud Detection System

├── Stream Processing (Kafka Streams/Flink)
├── Feature Store (Redis cluster for <1ms lookups)
├── Model Serving (ensemble of specialized models)
└── Decision API (risk scoring + business rules)
```

**Latency Optimization Strategies:**
- **Pre-computed Features**: User profiles cached in Redis
- **Model Ensemble**: Fast tree models + deep learning
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking I/O for external calls
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fail fast on external service timeouts
- **Geographic Distribution**: Models deployed in multiple regions

**Scalability Design:**
```python
# Simplified service architecture
class FraudDetectionService:
    async def score_transaction(self, transaction):
        # 1. Feature extraction (< 10ms)
        features = await self.extract_features(transaction)
        
        # 2. Model inference (< 50ms)
        risk_scores = await self.ensemble_predict(features)
        
        # 3. Business rules (< 5ms)
        decision = self.apply_business_rules(risk_scores)
        
        # 4. Log for monitoring (async)
        asyncio.create_task(self.log_decision(transaction, decision))
        
        return decision
```
